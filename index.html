					<h2>Who's this guy?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Before we start, I thought I'd say a little about who I am, so you can get a sense of where I'm coming from with this.

				<section data-background-image="assets/oriel.jpg">
					<h2>I'm a curator</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Professionally, I'm the curator of Oriel Science, which is a small science exhibition centre, attached to Swansea University.
						I spend most of my time making and sourcing exhibits, and acting as a go-between between scientists and the public.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="assets/svalbard.jpg">
					<h2>I'm a scientist</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						I'm also a working scientist - specifically I'm a glaciologist. I work on the flow and fracture of glacial ice, in Greenland
						and Antarctica.

					<h2>I'm a "creative coder"</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						I'm also a "creative coder", which is to say that I enjoy making computers do things for the purposes of art and entertainment.
						Mostly these days, that means making bots.

					<h2>What's a bot?</h2>
					<p class="fragment">
						A bot is a machine that takes the place of a human in a communications medium</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						I trained as a mathematician, so I like to start from definitions. This is the definition I find most useful. As humans,
						we create systems for interacting with each other. If we take a machine and insert it into that system, playing the
						role of a human, then that's what I call a bot. The machine still obeys the rules of the system in the same way that
						a human would - we don't interact with the machine any differently to a human.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img width="50%" src="assets/answeringmachine.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						Here's an example of a bot. We created the telephone network as a way for humans to talk to each other. At some point, someone
						decided to plug a machine into that system. You call a number, expecting to talk to a human, but instead you talk to
						a machine. The affordances of the telephone haven't changed - the phone hasn't suddenly sprouted a keyboard and mouse.
						You still have to speak to the machine as you would to a human. From the perspective of the telephone network, you
						and the answering machine are the same kind of thing.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						A bot is a
						<s>machine</s> <strong>computer program</strong> that takes the place of a human in a
						<s>communications medium</s> <strong>social network</strong></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now, it's 2017, so most of the "machines" that we interact with are actually computer programs, and most of the communications
						media are actually social networks. But the underlying principles are the same. We're still looking at machines which
						interact on human terms. Some people like to argue that this is a dehumanising development. We're taking human communication,
						which has already been abstracted into 140 characters of text or whatever, and we're introducing machines into the
						mix, so we don't know if we're talking to a real human or not. I'm sympathetic to that view, but I would counter that
						there's a rehumanising aspect as well - we're forcing the machines to interact on our terms, not theirs. Also, probably
						worth saying that Twitter is by far the dominant social network for bots. There are various reasons for that, which
						I'm happy to talk about afterwards if anyone's interested.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img height="600px" src="assets/spam.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						So here are some examples of bots. This young lady who followed me on Twitter the other day is a classic spam bot. She follows
						people, posts some saucy photos, and tries to get you to click on this link, which turns out to be a malware delivery
						system.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img height="600px" src="assets/trump.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						This is a more topical use of bots. It's interesting to see how crude this stuff is - identical posts with no variation -
						very easy to filter out and block. Spam bots have been using much more sophisticated techniques for decades.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img height="600px" src="assets/microsoft.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						And this is what the tech industry would like you to think bots are all about. A sort of automated personal shopper. I can't
						say that I see the point, personally, but there's a ridiculous amount of money being spent on this, so basic economic
						theory says that either there's a point somewhere, or that the entire tech industry is a sham.
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h2>"Art bots"</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Programs which generate "content"</p>
					<p class="fragment">Usually run on a schedule</p>
					<p class="fragment">Mostly disconnected posts</p>
					<p class="fragment">Often not interactive</p>
					<p class="fragment">...very like a spam bot</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						What I want to talk about today are "art bots" - bots made for artistic or entertainment purposes. They're sort of embarassingly
						similar to spam bots, but they're not usually trying to get you to click on a dodgy link.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-twitter-embed="botston">
					<h3>Bot-ston (Martin O'Leary)</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						By way of example, this is one of my bots, Bot-ston. It generates new lyrics to the "Gaston" song from Disney's Beauty and
						the Beast, and sets them to music. You follow this on Twitter, and four times a day you get a little video clip that
						makes you smile.

					<h2>Bots as performers</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						For the rest of the talk, I'm going to go through some bots, and talk about how they work aesthetically.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Performance</h2>
					<img width="30%" src="assets/romeo.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle">
					<span class="fragment"> → <img style="vertical-align:middle" width="10%" src="assets/question.png"></span>
					<span class="fragment"> → <img width="30%" src="assets/romeoplus.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle"></span>
					<aside class="notes">
						I want to start by talking about performance. If we think about a play, then we have a script, which is a static artifact,
						and then it gets performed, and at the end there might be a recording, which is also a static artifact. But neither
						of these things is the play. The play - the primary work of art - is the ephemeral thing in the middle, the performance.
						We can think the same way about computer programs. We have some source code, which we can save and archive, and we
						have some output, which we can also save and archive. But there's a thing in the middle, which we can't save, because
						it's a process, and it can't be stripped from its context. There's obviously a difference between a play and a computer
						program, because the performance of a play involves human beings, and the running of a computer program is an entirely
						inanimate thing. The difference with a bot though, is that the program is presenting itself as a human, or human-equivalent
						thing. So from the perspective of the audience, there is a performance happening, even if that's not really what's
						going on at the performer end.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-twitter-embed="CRASH__N__BURN">
					<h3>CRASH__N__BURN (Stephanie Hyland)</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Here's a simple example of a bot performance. CRASH__N__BURN does a reading of the script to the 199? movie Hackers, at fairly
						irregular intervals - I think whenever Stephanie really feels like it. It takes about three or four weeks to do a full
						run-through, then it goes quiet until the next performance.

					<h3>555 µHz (Ramsey Nasser)</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						A similar project is 555µHz, by Ramsey Nasser. This took the movie Top Gun, cut it into images about a second apart, and
						posted them at half-hourly intervals. It had a pretty similar community vibe. However, as you can see if you know the
						movie, it only got about a quarter of the way through.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-iframe="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/the-top-gun-twitter-flipbook-has-been-shutdown">
					<aside class="notes">
						The reason for that is that it got hit with a cease and desist order by Paramount, who didn't want people distributing their
						movie this way. So now there's just a decaying Twitter feed, with some of the images still there, others replaced with
						copyright infringement warnings.

					<h2>Bots as performers</h2>
					<p>Long, slow, casual performance</p>
					<p>Audience interaction</p>
					<p>Bounded or unbounded</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						So, summing up some qualities of bots as performers. These are long performances that you wander in and out of. You don't
						pay attention to the whole thing. They're interactive - even if the bot doesn't actually reply, the audience interacts
						with each other. Part of what drives this is having the bot be on the same level as the audience - there's no privileged
						"stage" position. And finally, they can be bounded or unbounded, but finiteness definitely adds to the sense of performance.

							This is Darius Kazemi's "Sorting Hat Bot", which is a pretty straightforward fun thing. You follow it, and it sorts you into
							a Harry Potter house, and it writes a little poem about you.
						</p>

							To an experienced coder, this is not a complex thing. You get some word lists, and you pick from them at random. The rhyming

					<blockquote>The only secret of magic is that I'm willing to work harder on it than you think it's worth.</blockquote>
					<p>Penn Jillette</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						This makes me think of this quote from the magician Penn Jillette. The way magic works is by convincing you that the real
						explanation is less plausible than magic. So if you go to enough effort, people will assume you didn't, and that there's
						some simple trick instead. But people are terrible at judging the amount of work that computers do. Looking through
						every adjective in English, looking for one that rhymes with "born", is something a computer can do in microseconds.
						So it's very easy to convince people that you're doing something more complex than you are.

						This is olivia taters, who's a sort of fake teenage girl. She assembles these sentences which are mostly nonsensical, but
						every so often there's something there which seems too real. So people assume there's something sophisticated going
						on. But there really isn't. Everything olivia says is assembled by splicing together fragments of real tweets.

				<section data-twitter-embed="unchartedatlas">
					<h3>Uncharted Atlas (Martin O'Leary)</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						This is one of mine, to show the flipside. You can deploy a simple procedure to appear complex, or you can do something really
						complex with a simple effect. This is generating fantasy maps, like you'd find in a cheap paperback sword and sorcery
						novel. The amount of computation that goes into these is obscene. They're doing erosion modelling, and routing rivers
						and all these things, for an output which is meant to look like a quick sketch.

					<h3>Museum Bot (Darius Kazemi)</h3>

						This is one of the most common kinds of bots - it has a large pool of images, in this case the catalogue of the Metropolitan

					<h3>Old School Flyers (Darius Kazemi)</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						What I think are really great, are hyper-specific bots, like this one which shares old school hip-hop flyers. This is a much
						more curated experience, and it gives the audience more scope to control what they want to see. If I follow Museum
						Bot, I get everything from the Met, even if I'm only interested in pottery, say. This is focused delivery of the stuff

					<h3>Moon Shot Bot (Darius Kazemi)</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						This works really well for collections which would be a bit intimidating to look at all at once. The photos from the Apollo
						program are amazing, but to be honest I've had enough after about half a dozen. By drip-feeding them over time, you
						get a much better experience. It sort of worms its way into your life. And the archive is still there if you want a
						more full-on experience.

						Of course, if you have a big and varied archive, you can easily slice and dice it to make something more focused. This shows
						all the dogs in the New York Public Library digital collection.

						Images are popular, but you can also have text-based archives. This is sharing deaths from medieval coroner's reports. Some
						of them are darkly comic, but over time they build to give a real sense of medieval life.

						We can also use collections as part of a larger project. This is taking images from the collection of the Tate, and putting
						it through some image recognition code, then attempting to generate "art criticism".

					<h3>Archillect (Murat Pak)</h3>

						Everything I've shown you so far has been using a random selection from a human-curated selection. It's curation, but maybe
						not super interesting curation. This is an attempt at automating curation. It posts images, looks at how many likes
						and retweets they get, and tries to find more images which are similar to the popular ones. Over time it has evolved
						a particular aesthetic, which I always think feels a bit Ridley Scott. I should add that some people take issue with
						this bot because it doesn't provide attribution for its images - the author claims this is because that's technically
						difficult, which I don't think is a very convincing argument for unethical behaviour.

					Before I finish, I should acknowledge that there's a huge gap in what I've talked about here, which is how bots interact with poetry. This is a whole thing, and I've included some links here to people who can talk about it better than I can.
